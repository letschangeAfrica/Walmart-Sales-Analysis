sir in report how many visuals we should add to tackle one question/problem statment ?































we need to do it when we have more than one data table?  what if we have only one table? -- Data Modeling is NOT Required!!!



if time allows, Could you please explain active vs inactive and cross and bi-directiinal concept in modelling.
